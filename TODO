== Hairball detangler TODO ==
=== Features ===
* Fix node coloring visual style.   DONE
** Set up some default colors in JS ob  DONE
** autogenerate color input pickers based on GOSlim results DONE
** Actually make it change colors DONE
* Set up network fill part (move callback between getInts and getGOSlim DONE
* Change AddNetwork to accomodate DONE
* make "delete" node permanent (i.e, delete from Node{} -> ban list DONE
* Add prune option for singally connected nodes?  Track node "order"
* delete all selected nodes
* Allow edge color changes
** track edge types in add Network, default colors autogenerate checkboxes 
* Allow node shape changes
** autogenerate shape switchers  (note: inverted from colors)
* Create Kinase autocomplete, TF autocomplete, others?
* Re-allow genetic interaction
* Use genetic interaction (types) to directionalize physical network.  Filter by phenotype?
* show global interaction counts, edge limits. DONE
* fetch and show interaction counts by node 
* add node weights  DONE
* add "waiting" or spinning wheel - in newer version of jquery-ui (unreleased)
* use "ban" list for promiscuous proteins DONE
* re-write node color storage to have mapping of terms -> nodes (faster, I hope)
* selection based queries: given selection of nodes, find all connections between them.
* edge merging - maybe have Biochem. active edges supersede regular physical interactions.
* creation of color picker elements neglects possibility that a gene has an unidentified BP slim term, loop could be inverted.
* brighten node selection halo, hide/mist out  non-selected edges
* wait for jquery-ui-layout compatible with jq 1.6 to get released or otherwise fix layout issues so that windows can move around
* Add phenotypes, phenotype based node coloring / selection
* Add selection based on MF/shape, BP/color, CC?, phenotype, pathway?
* filter nodes/edges based on cellular component, other GO terms.
* Define: modules - set of nodes that that all interact  for A find all B such that Bi<->Bj and Bi<->A
* Add "find" gene by name lookup (autocomplete -> select)
* Mark nodes that have had their "fetch" done - alternate border color?
* have 2 gene entries - one == new network, other = expand network
* collapse selected nodes into supernode (complex)
* context menu - lock a nodes color (or selection of nodes)
* How to filter "parallel" pathways?? (e.g,. alternate cyclins) - Positive Genetic Ints!
** replace [selectedNodes] with singleNode -> edges = sum of all edges of [selectedNodes].  Set to large size.
** allow user entered name
** reversable
* layout - cell Donut?
* Use node borders to indicate essentiality (phenotype)??
* consider GO/phenotype "list" queries; e.g, show all genetic interactions between all TFs, or within a pathway.
* Represent genes(rnas?) as separate nodes - genetic interactions between genes, regulatory protein->gene, or protein->rna
* PEPTIDASES - STE13 - not captured by ht datasets?
* Group nodes into metanodes-> Complexes (update to csw source in SVN!)
=== Code Org ===
* Save a bunch of JSON files to allow for no-net debugging
* Convert json->jsonp calls
* refactor global "hashes" into objects
